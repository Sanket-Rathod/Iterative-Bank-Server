2. Run by providing port number - java server/server.java 3550

Commands to run client - 
1. Compile - javac client/client.java 
2. Run by providing on which remote the server is running and port number of server -  java client/client.java remote02.cs.binghamton.edu 3550

Please note in passwd and balance files username and details like password or balance should be seperated by single space bar. For example - 

alice 81dc9bdb52d04dc20036dbd8313ed055
